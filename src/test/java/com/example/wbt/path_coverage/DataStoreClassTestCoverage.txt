==================== WHITE BOX TESTING COVERAGE CHECK ====================

Class Under Test: DataStore
Testing Technique: White Box Testing – Statement , Branch , Condition Coverage

---------------------------------------------------------
1. addMovie(Movie movie)
---------------------------------------------------------
Covered Paths:
- Loop executes 0 times (first movie added) -> Test Case 1
- Loop executes with multiple movies -> Test Case 2 
- Duplicate numeric ID detected -> Test Case 3 

Coverage Achieved:
- Statement Coverage: 100% 
- Branch Coverage: 100%
- Condition Coverage: 100%

---------------------------------------------------------
2. addUser(User user)
---------------------------------------------------------
Covered Paths:
- Valid user integrity ( user added ) -> Test Case 4 
- Invalid integrity (missing liked movie) -> Test Case 5
- Invalid integrity (duplicate user ID) -> Test Case 6

Note:
- checkIntegrity() never returns false; it either returns true or throws.
- Therefore we check with assert equal and assert throws in case of true or 
exception thrown.

Coverage Achieved:
- Statement Coverage: 100%
- Branch Coverage: 100%
- Condition Coverage: (not applicable since we don't have normal true & false)

---------------------------------------------------------
3. checkIntegrity(User user) (PRIVATE – thus tested indirectly)
---------------------------------------------------------
Covered Paths:
- Liked movie exists 
- Liked movie does not exist
- Duplicate user ID
- All checks pass 

Coverage Achieved:
- Statement Coverage: 100%
- Branch Coverage: 100%
- Condition Coverage: 100%

---------------------------------------------------------
4. getMovieById(String id)
---------------------------------------------------------
Covered Paths:
- Movie found (return movie) -> Test Case 7
- Movie not found -> Test Case 8

Coverage Achieved:
- Statement Coverage: 100%
- Branch Coverage: 100%
- Condition Coverage: 100%

---------------------------------------------------------
OVERALL RESULT:
- Statement, Branch, and Condition coverage all finished
- All logical execution paths in DataStore are tested
